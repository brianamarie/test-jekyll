## Visualizing Config Files

# DEPRECATED: Please visit https://githubtraining.github.io/travis-ci/ for most up to date version

#### TL;DR:
There's no easy way to learn what can go into a `travis.yml` file. This tool aims to clear that up. It is rendered at [brianamarie.github.io/test-jekyll](brianamarie.github.io/test-jekyll) and is a *work in progress*. 

#### How it works:
- The dropdown menu features every possible field in a `travis.yml` file, along with brief descriptions and examples for each.
- The `index.html` file includes other files, referencing each section of a `travis.yml` file. You can find the individual sections in the `_includes` directory.
- To contribute, please pick an issue that correlates with each section and open a PR to address the changes. :heart: [You can find all of the tracking issues sorted in this project](https://github.com/brianamarie/test-jekyll/projects/1).
