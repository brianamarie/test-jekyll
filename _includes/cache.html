    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline"><code>cache</code> TL;DR</h5>
      <p>You can tell Travis CI to ignore parts of your code that will slow down the build. <strong>Optional.</strong>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline">What is <code>cache</code>?</h5>
      <p>Travis CI can cache content that does not often change, to speed up your build process. To use the caching feature, in your repository settings, set Build pushes to ON.
      <br><br>
      Travis CI fetches the cache for every build, including branches and pull requests.
      If a branch does not have its own cache, Travis CI fetches the master branch cache.
      There is one cache per branch and language version/ compiler version/ JDK version/ Gemfile location/ etc.
      Only modifications made to the cached directories from normal pushes are stored.
      <em>Please note that cache content is available to any build on the repository, including Pull Requests, so make sure you do not put any sensitive information in the cache.</em>
      <br><br>
      For more information on caching, see <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching">the detailed documentation</a>.
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline">When is <code>cache</code> necessary?</h5>
      <p>This decision may depend on the language of your project. The general rule of thumb is to cache parts of your code that will take a long time to load and won't change very often.
      <br><br>
      You might choose to cache things for the builds run for every small commit, but then include all portions of your code in tests before merging.</p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline"><code>cache</code> examples</h5>
      <pre><code>
      cache:
        bundler: true
        directories:
          - node_modules # NPM packages
      </pre></code>
